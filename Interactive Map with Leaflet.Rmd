####Map created in R Studio using leaflet (https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and annotations with R markdown
#####1. Some Northern California Points of Interest: Golden Gate Bridge, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and Silicon Valley Tech Museum (click the markers to show popups for the locations) 


```{r, leaflet, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
mapNorcal = leaflet() %>%
 addTiles() %>%
 addMarkers (lat= 37.819722, lng= -122.478611, popup="Golden Gate Bridge")%>%
 addMarkers (lat= 37.4275, lng = -122.1697, popup="Stanford University")%>%
 addMarkers (lat= 37.8719, lng = -122.2585, popup="University of California Berkeley")%>%
 addMarkers (lat= 37.3316, lng= -121.8901, popup="Silicon Valley Tech Museum")
mapNorcal

```

####2. Two major Northern California Cities: San Francisco and San Jose. Circles are added using the addCircles() function in leaflet. Click circles to show city name and population.

```{r, Bay Area Cities, echo=TRUE}
cities <- read.csv(textConnection("
City,Lat,Long,Pop
San Francisco,37.78, -122.41,864816
San Jose,37.35,-121.85,1026938"))
leaflet(cities) %>% 
        addTiles() %>%
        addCircles(lng = ~Long, lat = ~Lat, weight = 2, radius = ~sqrt(Pop)*10, popup=~paste(City, ", population=", Pop)
  )
```
